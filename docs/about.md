Learn about Gigahex, our mission and why you should start using it.

---

Gigahex speeds up building data applications, by creating developer centric user
interface for interacting with distributed systems like Apache Spark and Hadoop.
It provides a single interface to manage multiple distributed systems running
On-Prem or Cloud clusters.

## Mission

---

The iterative cycle of development, testing, deploying and fixing and then again
testing and so on, should be faster than ever. This can be made possible by
having an isolated development environment consisting of clusters, application
jars and monitoring dashboard for quick feedback loop.

Once deployed, it allows you to monitor the application, and get alerts when a
task is too slow, or the executor got killed by yarn cluster or the driver got
stuck while interacting with some database or S3. This will enable you to
quickly identify the root issue, and accelerate the deployment of the fix to
production.

## Why Choose Gigahex?

---

Gigahex has a concept of workspace, which is analogous to a project, where you
can manage different clusters for development, staging and production and deploy
jobs and monitor them. It's a single platform with a web based interface, to
manage your entire development and management needs for big data applications.
