### Objective

Install VS Code extension for Python and Jupyter and analyse sales data using
Pandas.

### About Pandas, Jupyter and Anaconda

#### Pandas

Pandas is a library written for Python to perform data manipulation and
analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical
tables and time series.

#### Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating and sharing computational
documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.

#### Anaconda

Anaconda is a distribution of Python and R for package management and
deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages for easy
installation and management.

### Setup the development environment

- Download and install
  [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Open the Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment by performing the
  following command replacing _**sales**_ with the name you
  want.<br/>`conda create --name sales`
- To activate the environment you created, perform the following command
  replacing _**sales**_ with the name you used.<br/> `conda activate sales`
- Once activated, you can notice that your prompt changed from **(base)** to
  your environment name. This indicates that your environment is activated.
- To install pandas, perform `conda install pandas`
- To install ipykernel, perform `conda activate ipykernel`. The ipykernel aka
  IPython kernel is the execution backend for the Jupyter and an essential
  component.
- Now, open VSCode and install the _**Jupyter**_ extension from the
  marketplace/extensions. To open extensions, either press Ctrl+Shift+X for
  shortcut or click on the extensions icon on the left of VSCode and search
  _**Jupyter**_. Click on the first result that appears and install.<br/>

- Create a new jupyter notebook by either creating a new .ipynb file in your
  workspace or by running the following command from the Command Palette
  (Ctrl+Shift+P) and save it.<br/> `Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook`
- Click _**Select Kernel**_ present on top-right and choose the appropriate
  kernel that is of the same name as the conda environment you created.

- Create a file named "sales.csv" in the same location as the jupyter file and
  copy the data displayed below inorder to work using pandas. The following
  image shows you how the data in the csv file should be present.

- Try printing 'hello world' in python to verify if it runs properly.

### Code explaination

Below is the entire code for the task mentioned. Let's go through it
line-by-line.

<Gist id="3f790593fd3a45a4f0898c27572430c7" />

- Pandas library is imported.
- read_csv() is used to read .csv files such as the `sales.csv` and is stored in
  data variable.
- The data variable is printed to view the contents of the file.
- The max `sales_amount` is found using max(). The output is compared using the
  equality operator with every single value in the `sales_amount` column to get
  a list of boolean values to easily retrieve the row that satisfies the
  condition.
- Since we need only item and date, we restrict it to those two columns and
  print the output.
